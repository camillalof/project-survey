Project Survey

This is a survey form built with React Hooks and design I made that was inspired by forms at https://www.typeform.com/. In this project I use React useState hook and props to collect inputs from users and then display it.

I used React hooks (especially useState), CSS, different input types and props in this app.

If I would of had more time I would of focused more on accessability and maybee some animations for each question.
